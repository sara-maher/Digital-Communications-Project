All the schemes are done using a random number generator, a modulation and demodulation block, an AGWN channel, a constellation plot block, an error rate calculator block, and in the case of using raised cosine, a raised cosine transmitter and receiver blocks, with t set to 100.0, they differ in the values fed to the generator, and the modulation/ demodulation blocks used.

- **BPSK Modulation**:

producing random numbers between 0,1, and using a BPSK Modulator and demodulator.


- **QPSK Modulation**:

producing random numbers between 0,3, and using a QPSK Modulator and demodulator.


- **FSK Modulation**:

producing random numbers between 0,7, and using a FSK Modulator and demodulator.


- **QAM 16 Modulation**:

producing random numbers between 0,15, and using a QAM Modulator and demodulator, setting M to 16.


- **QAM 64 Modulation**:

producing random numbers between 0,63, and using a QAM Modulator and demodulator, setting M to 64.
